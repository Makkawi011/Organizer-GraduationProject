# Summary:
Organizer a tool called that automates the process of organizing system architecture files and folders based on the developerâ€™s preference. So, for now, that could be used by the client to organize the structure of their source code or a part of it. This will result in more usable source code as it will be easier to surf, access and read.

## Important note:
There are two versions of this project, the first is a Docker Container, which contains a [Console Project](https://github.com/MoMakkawi/Organizer), while (This Version Here) the second is Soucre Generator Run at Compite-Time.

# General idea:
This project is in the field of code generation, exactly in compile-time source code generation (source generator), It generates source code files during compile time.
this project presents a source code generator created with Roslyn source generator (SG) for .NET developers. the SG presented is called Organizer. It meant to organize any unorganized C# code as requested by the client, by restructuring the base types (classes, interfaces, records, enumerations, structs) in different folders and files according to the needs of the client using a set of services. The meaning of unorganized code in the scope of The Organizer is C# code files full of base types.
## The services provided by the Organizer are:
 * A service to create folder(s) to contain generated files.
 * A service to include base type(s) in a specific generated folder depending on a type name or a pattern.
 * A service to change the name(s) of specific type(s) depending on a base type name or pattern of multiple base types.
 * A service to ignore type(s) depending on a base type name or a pattern of multiple types.
 * Ability to exclude specific types from the creation or update patterns depending on a type name.
